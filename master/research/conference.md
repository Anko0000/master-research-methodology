### 発表内容概要
As smartphones have become widely used worldwide, Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU) has become a significant social concern. Indeed, several studies suggest that PSU may cause physical and psychosocial problems, including disrupted life rhythms, deteriorating social relationships, and disruptions in daily life. Despite these issues, the therapies of PSUs, including psychological interventions, remain poorly established. For these issues, we aimed to develop novel psychological interventions for PSUs. Firstly, we investigated potential associations between personal characteristics and smartphone usage data through machine learning. Our hypothesis is the specific types of PSU may contribute to developing optimal psychological treatment of PUS. We conducted an online survey of 100 Japanese adults aged 20 to 70 via an online cloud service. The survey included individual characteristics, smartphone usage, and log data (app usage time, check counts). Based on valid responses from 97 participants (61 female, age: mean 42.27, sd:10.01.) who agreed to informed consent, we performed an exploratory factor analysis on the smartphone usage data. We found five factors: (i) learning and reading, (ii) time-killing, (iii) gaming and finance, (iv) new relationships, and (v) work and management. Latent Profile Analysis, a clustering technique, revealed three distinct clusters based on these five factors. Notably, factors(ii) time-killing, (iv) new relationships, and (v) work and management showed a significant correlation with the score on the Smartphone Addiction Scale. These findings suggest that individuals with higher scores in time-killing, seeking new relationships, and working with smartphones may have a higher propensity for PSU. Further studies of these results may lead to more tailored interventions for PSU.
